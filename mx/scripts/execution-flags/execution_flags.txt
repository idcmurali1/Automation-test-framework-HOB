#

#       to a defect in the Android app where the orders in that list do not show the Order Number to differentiate them.

IOS_ORDERS_HISTORY_WORKAROUND=true
#
#       Controls whether or not to treat the Order at the top of the Orders History list as the most recent order due to
#       a defect in the iOS app where the orders in that list do not show the Order Number to differentiate them.

IOS_TURN_OFF_ORDER_INFO_ASSERTION_IN_ORDERS_HISTORY=true
#
#       Controls whether to turn off the Order Information assertion in Orders History.
#       In iOS, currently, none of the elements in Orders History has information about the Order Number, so there is
#       no way to tie the elements to the Order they belong to perform the assertion correctly.

IOS_LOGIN_AS_REGISTERED_USER_WORKAROUND=true
#
#       Turns on/off the execution of the workaround to log in after finishing the onboarding steps due to iOS not
#       having the login button inside the onboarding aside from Android. Turn on to log in in Account page after the
#       onboarding steps, turn off to log in inside the onboarding as usual.

IOS_SKIP_STORE_CHANGE_WORKAROUND=true
#
#       Turns on/off the execution of the workaround to skip the changing of the store in home page due to an issue where
#       appium cannot access the store selector popup and cannot interact with it.

IOS_SKIP_DELIVERY_DATE_ASSERTION=true
#
#       Turns on/off the execution of the workaround to skip the delivery date assertion
#       For pickup orders, the delivery date displays the string 'Pickup' in the DOM instead of the displayed delivery date value.

IOS_CART_PRODUCT_ASSERTIONS_WORKAROUND=true
#
#       Controls whether or not to run the workaround product price assertions in Cart page because currently the product
#       price data can only be obtained from a single string for each product and cannot verify the isolated values.

IOS_PHONE_UPDATES_OPT_OUT_WORKAROUND_IN_REVIEW_ORDER=true
#
#       If set to 'true', executes a workaround in Review Order Page to opt out from Phone Updates Notifications.
#       There's currently a P3 issue where the user needs to tap twice the checkbox to opt out.
#       (https://jira.walmart.com/browse/MXMOB-2895)
