  # DESCRIPTION: Sets the Test Case Step being currently executed (to be used internally in the construction of the
  #   final report that will be created once the Test Case execution finishes) and assign the Names of the Squads that
  #   must be notified in case of the Test Case Execution fails in this Step.
  #
  #   Call this function before calling all other functions that represent a new step from your Test Case, this way, if
  #   the Test Case execution fails, the report will have a way to identify which Step was being executed when the
  #   test failure happened and which Squads must be notified about it.
  #
  #   This function does not perform the execution of the step, it only logs the given step in the console as well as
  #   in the R2 Log and the console with the default color, and internally stores the data required to construct the
  #   final execution report.
  #
  #   * This function is meant to be executed in the Main Scenario as many times as required (as many as Steps your
  #     Test Case have).
  #
  #       i.e. Let's say you have a Test Case with these steps:
  #
  #              1) Navigate Onboarding all the way to OD Home
  #              2) Navigate to Profile and Log into the app
  #              3) Navigate to Home and perform a Product Search through SLP
  #
  #            You could code the following in your Main scenario...
  #
  #              - executeFunction:
  #                  name: mx.squad-reporting.setTestCaseStep
  #                  params:
  #                    - name: step

  #                    - name: squadNames
  #                      string: 'Squad_001 | Squad_003'
  #
  #              <then you call here all other functions to accomplish that piece of logic that step requires>
  #              <then you call the setTestCaseStep function again>
  #
  #              - executeFunction:

  #              <then you call here all other functions to accomplish that piece of logic that step requires>
  #              <then you call the setTestCaseStep function again>
  #              <and so on, up to as many steps your Test Case have>
  #
  # PARAMS: ${step}        [Mandatory]  String that describes the Step that will be executed afterwards.
  #
  #         ${squadNames}  [Mandatory]  Name(s) of the Squad(s) that must be notified in case of Step failure.
  #                                     Provide a string with a single Squad Name or multiple Squad Names, separating
  #                                     them by '|' (with or without spaces).
  #                                       i.e. SQUAD001

  # DESCRIPTION: Logs the information about the Current Step that was being executed and the Squads to be informed in
  #   case the Test Case Execution finished with errors, in a JSON file inside the ./squad-report/ folder.
  #
  #   Each Test Case logs its own file using the name of the Test Case that was set up with the function
  #   'mx.squad-reporting.setTestCaseName'.
  #
  #   If the Test Case name was not set properly in the Before Scenario, this function will use a timestamp to assign
  #   the file name.
  #
  #   If the Step were not set properly along the flow in the Main Scenario, this function will use the default string
  #   '<UNKNOWN_TEST_CASE_STEP>' as step to report the failure.
  #
  #   If the Squad Names were not set properly along with the Step, this function will report the failure to the
  #   'default' squad that must be configured in the ./squad-reporting-util/squads-info.json file.
  #
  #   * This function is meant to be executed in the After Scenario in the Test Case.
  #
  # PARAMS: ${testCaseExecutionStatus}  [Mandatory]  Status if the Test Case Execution:
  #                                                    Values:
  #                                                      - true: Test Case execution finished without error, or
  #                                                      - false: Test Case execution finished with errors.
