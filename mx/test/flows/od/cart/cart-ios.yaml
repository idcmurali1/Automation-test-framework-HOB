  # DESCRIPTION: Performs all the following assertions for the given product name.
  #   - Listed/NotListed: Whether the product is listed or not listed in the Cart.
  #   - Availability: Whether the product is listed in the Available Products List or the OOS Products list.
  #   - Expected Quantity: Whether the displayed expected quantity is correct. This assertion is performed based in the Product Type which is calculated by the function.
  #   - Expected Price: Whether the displayed price (unit price) is correct.
  #   - Expected Subtotal: Whether the displayed subtotal is correct.
  # PARAMS:  ${productName}             [Mandatory]  Name of the product to perform assertions for.
  #          ${productListed}           [Mandatory]  Option to check whether the product is listed or not listed in the Cart. Options: [ listed | notListed ]
  #                                                    If option is 'notListed', this method will perform only this assertion will omit all the other assertions.
  #          ${availability}            [Mandatory]  Option to check whether the product should be listed in the Available or the OOS Products List. Options: [ available | notAvailable | null ]
  #                                                    If option is 'notAvailable', this method will perform this assertion but will not perform Expected Quantity, Expected Price and Expected Subtotal assertions.
  #                                                    If option is 'null', this assertion will be skipped (also the Expected Quantity, Expected Price and Expected Subtotal assertions will be skipped).
  #          ${expectedQuantity}        [Mandatory]  Expected quantity the product should show. Options: [ <numeric value> | null ]
  #                                                    If option is a numeric value, the method will assert that as the expected quantity the product should display.
  #                                                    If option is 'null', this assertion will be skipped.
  #          ${expectedWeightQuantity}  [Mandatory]  Expected weight quantity the product should should. Options: [ <numeric value> ]
  #                                                    It is needed only when the product is 'Weight' or 'Dual'. For 'Pieces' products it is not; it can be empty value or 'null'.
  #          ${expectedUnitPrice}       [Mandatory]  Expected price the product should show. Options: [ <numeric value> | null ]
  #                                                    If option is a numeric value, the method will assert that as the expected price the product should display.
  #                                                    If option is 'null', this assertion will be skipped.
  #          ${expectedSubtotal}        [Mandatory]  Expected sub-total the product should show. Options: [ <numeric value> | null ]
  #                                                    If option is a numeric value, the method will assert that as the expected subtotal the product should display.
  #                                                    If option is 'null', this assertion will be skipped.
  #          ${expectedOriginalPrice}]  [Mandatory]  Expected original price before discount in case it has a promotion badge. Options: [ <numeric value> | null ]
  #                                                    If option is a numeric value, the method will assert that as the expected original price the product should display.
  #                                                    If option is 'null', this assertion will be skipped.
  # RETURNS: ${returnedFinalSubtotal}   This is the updated product subtotal that will be calculated in case a product with Multi-Savings promotion was found in cart.

  # DESCRIPTION: Performs all the following WORKAROUND assertions for the given product name.
  #   - Listed/NotListed: Whether the product is listed or not listed in the Cart.
  #   - Availability: Whether the product is listed in the Available Products List or the OOS Products list.
  #   - Expected Quantity: Whether the displayed expected quantity is correct. This assertion is performed based in the Prodyct Type which is calculated by the function.
  #   - Expected Unit Price: Whether the displayed price (unit price) is correct.
  #   - Expected Subtotal: Whether the displayed subtotal is correct.
  # PARAMS:  ${productName}             [Mandatory]  Name of the product to perform assertions for.
  #          ${productListed}           [Mandatory]  Option to check whether the product is listed or not listed in the Cart. Options: [ listed | notListed ]
  #                                                    If option is 'notListed', this method will perform only this assertion will omit all the other assertions.
  #          ${availability}            [Mandatory]  Option to check whether the product should be listed in the Available or the OOS Products List. Options: [ available | notAvailable | null ]
  #                                                    If option is 'notAvailable', this method will perform this assertion but will not perform Expected Quantity, Expected Price and Expected Subtotal assertions.
  #                                                    If option is 'null', this assertion will be skipped (also the Expected Quantity, Expected Price and Expected Subtotal assertions will be skipped).
  #          ${expectedQuantity}        [Mandatory]  Expected quantity the product should show. Options: [ <numeric value> | null ]
  #                                                    If option is a numeric value, the method will assert that as the expected quantity the product should display.
  #                                                    If option is 'null', this assertion will be skipped.
  #          ${expectedWeightQuantity}  [Mandatory]  Expected weight quantity the product should should. Options: [ <numeric value> ]
  #                                                    It is needed only when the product is 'Weight' or 'Dual'. For 'Pieces' products it is not; it can be empty value or 'null'.
  #          ${expectedUnitPrice}       [Mandatory]  Expected price the product should show. Options: [ <numeric value> | null ]
  #                                                    If option is a numeric value, the method will assert that as the expected price the product should display.
  #                                                    If option is 'null', this assertion will be skipped.
  #          ${expectedSubtotal}        [Mandatory]  Expected sub-total the product should show. Options: [ <numeric value> | null ]
  #                                                    If option is a numeric value, the method will assert that as the expected subtotal the product should display.
  #                                                    If option is 'null', this assertion will be skipped.
  #          ${expectedOriginalPrice}]  [Mandatory]  Expected original price before discount in case it has a promotion badge. Options: [ <numeric value> | null ]
  #                                                    If option is a numeric value, the method will assert that as the expected original price the product should display.
  #                                                    If option is 'null', this assertion will be skipped.
  # RETURNS: ${returnedFinalSubtotal}   This is the updated product subtotal that will be calculated in case a product with Multi-Savings promotion was found in cart.

  # DESCRIPTION: Performs all the following assertions for the given product name.
  #   - Product Listed:       Asserts the product is listed on Cart list.
  #   - Expected Quantity:    Whether the displayed expected quantity is correct. This assertion is performed based in the Product Type.
  #   - Expected Unit Price:  Whether the displayed price (unit price) is correct.
  #   - Expected Subtotal:    Whether the displayed subtotal is correct.
  #
  # PARAMS:  ${productName}             [Mandatory]  Name of the product to perform assertions for.
  #          ${productType}             [Optional]   Set to 'null' to prevent flow from getting the product's type on Cart Page.
  #          ${expectedQuantity}        [Mandatory]  Expected quantity the product should show. Options: [ <numeric value> | null ]
  #                                                    If option is a numeric value, the method will assert that as the expected quantity the product should display.
  #                                                    If option is 'null', this assertion will be skipped.
  #          ${expectedWeightQuantity}  [Mandatory]  Expected weight quantity the product should should. Options: [ <numeric value> ]
  #                                                    It is needed only when the product is 'Weight' or 'Dual'. For 'Pieces' products it is not; it can be empty value or 'null'.
  #          ${expectedUnitPrice}       [Mandatory]  Expected price the product should show. Options: [ <numeric value> | null ]
  #                                                    If option is a numeric value, the method will assert that as the expected price the product should display.
  #                                                    If option is 'null', this assertion will be skipped.
  #          ${expectedSubtotal}        [Mandatory]  Expected sub-total the product should show. Options: [ <numeric value> | null ]
  #                                                    If option is a numeric value, the method will assert that as the expected subtotal the product should display.
  #                                                    If option is 'null', this assertion will be skipped.
  # RETURNS: ${returnedFinalSubtotal}   This is the updated product subtotal that will be calculated in case a product with Multi-Savings promotion was found in cart.

  # DESCRIPTION: This flow is used to increase a Product's Quantity to its Max Purchase Limit based on its type, and 
  #     returns whatever the final max quantity ended up after the increments.
  #
  #     For Pieces Products: Max Purchase Limit is 99 pieces.
  #     For Weight Products: Max Purchase Limit is 20 kilograms (20,000 grams).
  #     For Dual Products:   Max Purchase Limit is 99 pieces or 20 kilograms (20,000 grams), whatever occurs first.
  #
  #     *   Consider that the supplier store may not have enough stock of the desired product to provide up to 99
  #         pieces or 20 kilograms. So, the Max Purchase Limit may be capped based on the product's stock available.
  #
  #         i.e. There's only 15 pieces of the given Pieces Product in the currently selected supplier store... the
  #         flow will not be able to increase the quantity up to 99 pieces. Instead, it will identify the max stock was
  #         reached and will return 15 as the final max quantity so the developer can use this value, instead of the
  #         original 99 pieces limit, for future assertions or calculations.
  #
  #     *   Additionally, this flow does not perform all the process alone. It determines by the given Product's Type
  #         which sub-flow to execute to perform the process appropriately. The process is slightly different
  #         depending on the Product's Type. See:
  #             - mx.flows.od.cart.increasePiecesProductToMaxQuantity
  #             - mx.flows.od.cart.increaseDualOrWeighableProductToMaxQuantity
  #
  # PARAMS:
  #     ${productName}  [Mandatory]
  #         Name of the Product to increase its quantity.
  #
  #     ${productType}  [Mandatory]
  #         Type of the Product. It's used to determine how to validate the Max Quantity.
  #         Options: [ Pieces | Dual | Weight | Weighable ]
  #
  #     ${productWeightConversionRate} [Conditional]
  #         How much grams are equal to 1 piece of the product. This value is needed only Dual and Weight Products.
  #         For Pieces Products, the flow will just not read this value.
  #
  # RETURNS:
  #     ${returnedMaxQuantity}  The final max quantity that the product was increased to. This might be used for cases
  #         where the supplier store do not have enough stock of that product and the user cannot purchase up to the
  #         original max limits, so the developer can use this value in following assertions and/or calculations.
