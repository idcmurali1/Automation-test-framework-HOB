  #--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  # DESCRIPTION: This flow performs all the Order Details assertions except for the Delivery Location. If you want to
  #     perform the Delivery Location assertions, call the desired function from the Order Details page.
  #
  # PARAMS:
  #     ${orderNumber}              [Mandatory]
  #         The Order Number expected to be displayed its details in the screen.
  #
  #     ${expectedOrderedDate}      [Mandatory]
  #         Ordered Date expected to be displayed.
  #         NOTE: when the order is placed the backend will obtain the date and assign it to the Order. When executing
  #         the automation the date can be obtained too, but separate from the backend process. Specially, near midnight,
  #         these 2 dates may differ due to the gap in time between the 2 calculations. To reduce the risk of this gap,
  #         obtain the order date right after placing the order. You can do it in 2 ways:
  #             1) By executing the 'mx/test/helpers/utils/getTodaysDateAsStringForAssertion.js' helper, or
  #             2) If you executed function 'mx.functions.review-order.tapPlaceOrder', this function will execute the
  #                helper mentioned in (1) and return the date.
  #
  #     ${expectedDeliveryMethod}   [Mandatory]
  #         Delivery Method expected to be displayed. Values: [ HomeDelivery | PickupDelivery ].
  #
  #     ${expectedOrderStatus}      [Mandatory]
  #         Expected Status the order should display. Values: [ Received | Preparing | Ready4Pickup | OnTheWay | Delivered ].
  #
  #     ${expectedBanner}           [Mandatory]
  #         Banner expected to be displayed. Values: [ Walmart | WalmartExpress ].
  #
  #     ${expectedDaySlot}          [Mandatory]
  #         Expected day the Delivery Slot should display. Use the value returned by 'mx.functions.reserve-slot.getSelectedDaySlot'.
  #                                                  
  #     ${expectedTimeSlot}         [Mandatory]
  #         Expected time the Delivery Slot should display. Use the value returned by 'mx.functions.reserve-slot.getSelectedTimeSlot'.
  #
  #     ${expectedProductsCount}    [Mandatory]
  #         Expected total quantity of purchased products. This value represents how many different products were
  #         added to the cart and not a sum of the quantity of all the products.
  #         i.e. If the user purchased 5 apples and 2 oranges, the ${expectedProductsCount} must be 2 (the number
  #         of products) instead of 7 (the sum of the quantities).
  #         
  #     ${expectedPaymentMethod}    [Mandatory]
  #         Expected Payment Method to be displayed. Values: [ CC/DC | PayAtDelivery | Paypal ].
  #
  #     ${expectedSubtotal}         [Mandatory]
  #         Expected Subtotal to be displayed. Provide a value without currency symbol '$' and with 2 decimals.
  #
  #     ${assertDiscount}           [Mandatory]
  #         Wether to perform or not the assertion of the discount applied to the order. Values: [ true | false ].
  #
  #     ${expectedDiscount}         [Conditioned]
  #         Discount expected to be displayed. This value is only used to perform the assertion when the param
  #         ${assertDiscount} is set to 'true', otherwise, the flow will ignore it.
  #         If the assertion is going to be done, provide a value without currency symbol '$' and with 2 decimals.
  #
  #     ${expectedDeliveryFee}      [Mandatory]
  #         Delivery Fee expected to be displayed. Provide a value without currency symbol '$' and with 2 decimals.
  #
  #     ${expectedTotal}            [Mandatory]
  #         Total expected to be displayed. Provide a value without currency symbol '$' and with 2 decimals.
  #
  # USES FLAGS:
  #     ${ASSERT_DELIVERY_SLOT_IN_ORDER_DETAILS}
  #         If set to 'true', the flow will perform assertion for the Delivery Slot in Order Details page.
  #         If set to 'false' or not set at all, it will perform the Delivery Slot assertion as expected.

  # # Description: This flow performs all the assertions related to products. It first asserts the product is listed, if
  # #              not, the flow throws an error, else the flow continues with product price assertion and ordered quantity
  # #              assertions by using the product type (collected before in previous steps of the TC) and asserts quantities
  # #              as pieces or weight (if dual, asserts both). After that, it verifies if the product is available (checks
  # #              if the 'add to cart' button is displayed or not), if false, the flow ends, if true, the flow continues.
  # #              Then it checks if the product has been added to cart or not, if false, the flow ends, if true, the flow
  # #              ends with product added quantity assertions depending on the product type (dual, pieces and weight).
  # # Param:  ${productName}                      [Mandatory]  Expected product name.
  # # Param:  ${expectedProductPrice}             [Mandatory]  Expected product price to assert.
  # # Param:  ${productType}                      [Mandatory]  Use a 'getProductType' function to get this value.
  # # Param:  ${expectedOrderedQuantityAsPieces}  [Mandatory]  Quantity to assert as pieces. (Ignored if not needed).
  # # Param:  ${expectedOrderedQuantityAsWeight}  [Mandatory]  Quantity to assert as weight (no need to add the "g" but

  # DESCRIPTION: This flow performs assertions on the first section of the page without Addresses or Totals information.
  #
  # PARAMS:
  #     ${orderNumber}              [Mandatory]
  #         The Order Number expected to be displayed its details in the screen.
  #
  #     ${expectedOrderedDate}      [Mandatory]
  #         Ordered Date expected to be displayed.
  #         NOTE: when the order is placed the backend will obtain the date and assign it to the Order. When executing
  #         the automation the date can be obtained too, but separate from the backend process. Specially, near midnight,
  #         these 2 dates may differ due to the gap in time between the 2 calculations. To reduce the risk of this gap,
  #         obtain the order date right after placing the order. You can do it in 2 ways:
  #             1) By executing the 'mx/test/helpers/utils/getTodaysDateAsStringForAssertion.js' helper, or
  #             2) If you executed function 'mx.functions.review-order.tapPlaceOrder', this function will execute the
  #                helper mentioned in (1) and return the date.
  #
  #     ${expectedDeliveryMethod}   [Mandatory]
  #         Delivery Method expected to be displayed. Values: [ HomeDelivery | PickupDelivery ].
  #
  #     ${expectedOrderStatus}      [Mandatory]
  #         Expected Status the order should display. Values: [ Received | Preparing | Ready4Pickup | OnTheWay | Delivered ].
  #
  #     ${expectedBanner}           [Mandatory]
  #         Banner expected to be displayed. Values: [ Walmart | WalmartExpress ].
  #
  #     ${expectedDaySlot}          [Mandatory]
  #         Expected day the Delivery Slot should display. Use the value returned by 'mx.functions.reserve-slot.getSelectedDaySlot'.
  #                                                  
  #     ${expectedTimeSlot}         [Mandatory]
  #         Expected time the Delivery Slot should display. Use the value returned by 'mx.functions.reserve-slot.getSelectedTimeSlot'.
  #
  #     ${expectedProductsCount}    [Mandatory]
  #         Expected total quantity of purchased products. This value represents how many different products were
  #         added to the cart and not a sum of the quantity of all the products.
  #         i.e. If the user purchased 5 apples and 2 oranges, the ${expectedProductsCount} must be 2 (the number
  #         of products) instead of 7 (the sum of the quantities).
  #
  # USES FLAGS:
  #     ${ASSERT_DELIVERY_SLOT_IN_ORDER_DETAILS}
  #         If set to 'true', the flow will perform assertion for the Delivery Slot in Order Details page.
  #         If set to 'false' or not set at all, it will perform the Delivery Slot assertion as expected.

  # DESCRIPTION: This flow performs all the assertions related to Totals and Payment.
  # NOTE:   The expected subtotal must always be equal to the sum of all the product's subtotals, but if there's a

  #           To calculate the new subtotal. This flow also calculates the final Total of the purchase.
  #
  # PARAMS:
  #     ${expectedPaymentMethod}    [Mandatory]
  #         Expected Payment Method to be displayed. Values: [ CC/DC | PayAtDelivery | Paypal ].

  #   This method asserts the subtotal before and after discounts, it assumes there were discounts in the cart.
  # PARAMS:

  #                                   If there were discounts in cart, this value should be equal to the sum of all product subtotals
  #                                   after the discounts (the multi-savings promotion affects product subtotal).
